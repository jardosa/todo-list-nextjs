This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The following is a Next.js todo-list app with CSS [Tailwind](tailwindcss.com)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
open another terminal and
bash
npm run server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Json-server is being run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Backend used for this is a fake REST API from [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
